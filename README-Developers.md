Building and running on Desktop
===============================

Building and running the Ubuntu Music App is quite simple with clickable:

```

```

Debugging on the Desktop is recommended. The autopilot tests in this repository
are not usable anymore.

Code Style
==========

We are trying to use a common code style throughout the code base to maintain
uniformity and improve code clarity. Listed below are the code styles guides
that will be followed based on the language used.

* [QML](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qml-codingconventions.html)
* [JS, C++](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
* Python - Code should follow PEP8 and Flake regulations

Note: In the QML code convention, ignore the Javascript code section guidelines.
So the sections that should be taken into account in the QML conventions are QML
Object Declarations, Grouped Properties and Lists.
